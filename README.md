## Required Files and Programs

#### mdEmail.dll

This is the c++ code of the Melissa Object. This file will be downloaded by Melissa Updater!

#### mdEmailJavaWrapper.dll

This file needs to be added as a Project Dependency.  This wrapper will need to be in the same directory as the program using it.

#### Data Files
- mdEmail.cfg
- mdEmail.db3

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
This project is compatible with Java 19

#### Install Java
Before starting, make sure that Java has been correctly installed on your machine and your environment paths are configured. 

You can download Java here: 
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/

You can check that your environment is set up correctly by opening a command prompt window and typing the following:
`java --version`

If you see the version number then you have installed Java and set up your environment paths correctly!

#### Set up Powershell settings
If running Powershell for the first time, you will need to run this command in the Powershell console: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`.
The console will then prompt you with the following warning shown in the image below. 
 - Enter `'A'`. 
 	- If successful, the console will not output any messages. (You may need to run Powershell as administrator to enforce this setting).

----------------------------------------

#### Download this project
```
git clone https://github.com/MelissaData/EmailObject-Java
cd EmailObject-Java
```

#### Set up Melissa Updater 

Melissa Updater is a CLI application allowing the user to update their Melissa applications/data. 

- Download Melissa Updater here: <https://releases.melissadata.net/Download/Library/WINDOWS/NET/ANY/latest/MelissaUpdater.exe>
- Create a folder within the cloned repo called `MelissaUpdater`.
- Put `MelissaUpdater.exe` in `MelissaUpdater` folder you just created.

----------------------------------------

#### Different ways to get data file(s)
1.  Using Melissa Updater
    - It will handle all of the data download/path and dll(s) for you. 
2.  If you already have the latest DQS release zip, you can find the data file(s) in there
	- To pass in your own data file path directory, you may either use the '-dataPath' parameter or enter the data file path directly in interactive mode.
	- Comment out this line "DownloadDataFiles -license $License" in the powershell script.
	- This will prevent you from having to redownload all the files.
	
## Run Powershell Script
Parameters:
- -email: a test email address
 	
  This is convenient when you want to get results for a specific email address in one run instead of testing multiple email addresss in interactive mode.

- -dataPath (optional): a data file path directory to test the Email Object
- -license (optional): a license string to test the Email Object
- -quiet (optional): add to the command if you do not want to get any console output from the Melissa Updater

When you have modified the script to match your data location, let's run the script. There are two modes:
- Interactive 

    The script will prompt the user for an email address, then use the provided number to test Email Object.  For example:
    ```
    .\MelissaEmailObjectWindowsJava.ps1
    ```
    For quiet mode:
    ```
    .\MelissaEmailObjectWindowsJava.ps1 -quiet
    ```
- Command Line 

    You can pass an email address in ```-email``` parameter and a license string in ```-license``` parameter to test Email Object. For example:
    ```
    .\MelissaEmailObjectWindowsJava.ps1 -email "info@melissa.com" 
    .\MelissaEmailObjectWindowsJava.ps1 -email "info@melissa.com" -license "<your_license_string>"
    ```
    For quiet mode:
    ```
    .\MelissaEmailObjectWindowsJava.ps1 -email "info@melissa.com" -quiet
    .\MelissaEmailObjectWindowsJava.ps1 -email "info@melissa.com" -license "<your_license_string>" -quiet
    ```
This is the expected output from a successful setup for interactive mode:
